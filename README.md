MySaasa 2.0

I'm going to start to rebuild MySaasa in flutter

Currently it just has some framework and scaffolding. There is a Redux store, with Android/IOS/Desktop/Web support
Web support is currently janky. Just develop mysaasa_core_flutter, and the copy/paste into mysaasa_core_web and fix the imports.

Hopefully the flutter team will improve web performance and developer experience significantly, but what works is promising.
